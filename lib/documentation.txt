Dear Aryan,

I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the assigned task of 
developing an Instagram Business Account Data Fetching App. Following the given 
instructions, I have utilized the Facebook Graph API to fetch data from a business 
account and implemented the required functionalities. I would like to provide a brief explanation of 
the assignment and the features I have implemented.

Assignment Summary:

Developed a Flutter app that fetches data from an Instagram business account or Instagram creator account using the Facebook Graph API.
Implemented user authentication and authorization using USER ID and ACCESS TOKEN.
Retrieved various account data, including media, followers, following, total likes, username, name, bio, and profile picture URL.
Stored the fetched data securely in the Firebase Realtime Database.
Implemented data retrieval from Firebase whenever needed.
Ensured the automatic daily refresh of data through backend server scheduling.

Steps:

1. Create a business or creator account on Instagram and connect it to a Facebook page.
2. Obtain the access token and user ID associated with your Instagram business account from the Facebook Developer platform.
3. Launch the app and enter the access token and the user Id in the designated fields.
4. Click on Get Meta Data button.
5. Let the app fetch and display the meta data of your Instagram business account, including media, followers, following, total likes, username, name, bio, and profile picture URL.

NOTE : We can access meta data such as followers,follows , posts, username, profile picture url
etc by calling {https://graph.facebook.com/v17.0/$userId?fields=followers_count,follows_count,media_count,username,profile_picture_url&access_token=$accessToken}
above url but we cannot access total number of Likes because likes is a part of MEDIA so we can't access it using the FIELD. 
Therefore, I have used the following url for accessing total number of likes
{https://graph.facebook.com/v17.0/$userId?media=like_count&access_token=$accessToken}
